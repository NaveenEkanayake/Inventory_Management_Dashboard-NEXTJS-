# Inventory Management Dashboard

The **Inventory Management Dashboard**, built with **Next.js**, **Redux**, and **PostgreSQL**, is designed to provide shop administrators with robust tools for managing and analyzing business operations. 

The dashboard delivers detailed insights into key metrics, including:
- Total expenses
- Discounts
- Popular product purchases
- Order summaries

Additionally, it features:
- A **user management module** for overseeing all shop users
- A **product management section** for viewing and creating products

To enhance usability, a **settings menu** in the navbar allows administrators to switch between **light** and **dark** themes, offering a personalized user experience tailored to individual preferences.
